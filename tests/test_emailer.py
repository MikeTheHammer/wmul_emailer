============ Change Log ============
2023-Jan-13 = Added tests for when the e-mail addresses are missing from both 
              the constructor and the function. Added/Modified tests for when 
              a single destination e-mail address is passed in. Re-wrote tests 
              to make use of wmul_test_utils.make_namedtuple. 

2022-May-06 = Changed License from MIT to GPLv2.

2018-May-18 = Created.
